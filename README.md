# UQLT-Simulations

Computational simulations and numerical validations derived exclusively from Unified Quantum Life Theory (UQLT). Original work of Clayton Andrew Houghland. © 2025–2026. All rights reserved.

## Summary of Repository

This repository contains computational implementations, simulation code, and numerical results that demonstrate and validate mechanisms from the Unified Quantum Life Theory (UQLT). All content is derived strictly from the author's original framework, including laws, equations, constants, mechanisms, and derivations (Valignity, ChronoCollapse, EMN pressure, C-Shift, etc.). No external theories, data-fitting, or ad-hoc additions are included.

The simulations produce layered structures, stable equilibria, time dilation effects, C-Shift redshift proxies, singularity avoidance, and other effects from uniform or void-like initial conditions.
